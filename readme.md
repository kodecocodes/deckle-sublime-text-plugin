# Deckle Sublime Text Plugin

## Summary 

This is a Sublime Text Plugin that opens the currently open file in the RayWenderlich.com Deckle Markdown Preview App.

Created 01-02-2018 by eric@issfl.com.
This work is based on the Marked 2 plugin that performs a similar function (https://github.com/icio/sublime-text-marked).

Tested on macOS with Sublime Text 3.

## Dependencies

* MacOS
* Deckle
  - **Note:** Ensure you've opened at least one RW markdown file prior to using this plugin. (On first launch after installation, Deckle always asks to open a file, even if one is being passed via the command line.)
* Sublime Text 3

## MacOS Installation

To install the plugin on your workstation:

  1. Copy the **Deckle** directory (and all the files inside) of this package to: **~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/**.
  1. Re-launch Sublime Text 3.

## Usage

After you install this plugin, there are multiple ways to launch Deckle with the currently opened file.

Open a RayWenderlich makrdown file in Sublime Text, then either:

* Open the **Command Palette** with **CMD+SHIFT+P** and type "deckle", then press **RETURN** or
* From the Sublime Text menu bar, select **Tools** then **Deckle**.
